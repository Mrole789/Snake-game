## 🚀 Getting Started  
Prerequisites  
- Python 3
- Turtle module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## 🎯 How to Play  
1. Use the Arrow Keys to control the snake:  
   - ⬆️ Up Arrow: Move Up  
   - ⬇️ Down Arrow: Move Down  
   - ⬅️ Left Arrow: Move Left  
   - ➡️ Right Arrow: Move Right  
2. Guide the snake to eat the red food dots  
3. Each food dot increases:  
   - Your score by 1 point  
   - The snake's length by 1 square part  
4. Avoid:  
   - Colliding with the walls  
   - Colliding with your own tail  
5. Try to beat your high score!
